Architecture ideas:

End-to-End CNN
    Input:
        - a fixed number of images (100)
    Output:
        - the next frame after the images
    Architecture:
        - a series of 2d conv, followed by linear layers?
        - a series of 3d conv, followed by linear layers?
        - add a descriminator to make the results look more realistic?
        - should the CNN compress the images to something smaller that a single image size? (encoding?)

- CNN Encoder -> LSTM -> Decoder?
    Input:
        - a series of single-images
    Output:
        - a series of single-images
    Architecture:
        - what are the differences between this as a convolutional LSTM?
        - train the encoder/first on single images
